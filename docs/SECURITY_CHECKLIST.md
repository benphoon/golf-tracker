# Security Testing Checklist

## Authentication Security

### ✅ Password Handling
- [x] Passwords never stored in plain text (handled by Supabase Auth)
- [x] Minimum password length enforced (6 characters)
- [x] Password confirmation required for signup
- [x] Secure password transmission (HTTPS)

### ✅ Session Management
- [x] JWT tokens managed securely by Supabase
- [x] Automatic token refresh implemented
- [x] Session persistence properly configured
- [x] Logout functionality clears session completely

### ✅ Authentication Flow
- [x] Proper error handling for invalid credentials
- [x] No sensitive information exposed in error messages
- [x] Rate limiting handled by Supabase (built-in protection)
- [x] User enumeration prevention (Supabase handles this)

## Data Security & Authorization

### ✅ Row Level Security (RLS)
- [x] RLS enabled on all user data tables
- [x] Users can only access their own rounds
- [x] Users can only access their own player data
- [x] Cross-user data access prevented

### ✅ Database Security
- [x] Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- [x] Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity
- [x] User input validation on client and server side
- [x] Database access controlled through RLS policies

### ✅ API Security
- [x] Authentication required for protected endpoints
- [x] User context validated on every request
- [x] No direct database access from client
- [x] Supabase API keys properly configured

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### ✅ Client-Side Validation
- [x] Email format validation
- [x] Password strength requirements
- [x] Score input validation (1-15 range)
- [x] Required field validation

### ✅ Server-Side Validation
- [x] Supabase handles authentication validation
- [x] Database constraints prevent invalid data
- [x] Type safety with TypeScript
- [x] Input sanitization through Supabase client

## Environment & Configuration Security

### ✅ Environment Variables
- [x] Sensitive credentials stored in environment variables
- [x] Public vs private API keys properly configured
- [x] No secrets committed to version control
- [x] Development vs production environment separation

### ✅ HTTPS & Transport Security
- [x] All API calls use HTTPS
- [x] Secure cookie settings for sessions
- [x] Proper CORS configuration
- [x] No sensitive data in URLs

## Privacy & Data Protection

### ✅ Data Isolation
- [x] Users cannot access other users' data
- [x] Guest sessions isolated from authenticated sessions
- [x] Personal data properly scoped to user account
- [x] Account deletion removes all associated data

### ✅ Minimal Data Collection
- [x] Only necessary user data collected (email, display name)
- [x] No tracking beyond essential functionality
- [x] Clear data ownership (users own their rounds)
- [x] Optional data fields clearly marked

## Error Handling & Logging

### ✅ Secure Error Handling
- [x] Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- [x] Detailed errors logged server-side only
- [x] No stack traces exposed to users
- [x] Graceful degradation for auth failures

### ✅ Audit Trail
- [x] User actions tracked (creation, login)
- [x] Data modifications logged
- [x] Failed authentication attempts logged
- [x] No sensitive data in logs

## Testing & Verification

### ✅ Automated Security Tests
- [x] Authentication flow tests
- [x] Authorization boundary tests
- [x] Input validation tests
- [x] Error handling tests

### ✅ Manual Security Testing
- [x] Attempt to access other users' data
- [x] Test authentication bypass attempts
- [x] Verify RLS policies work correctly
- [x] Test session management edge cases

## Security Monitoring

### ✅ Production Security
- [x] Supabase security monitoring enabled
- [x] Regular security updates through dependency management
- [x] Environment configuration properly secured
- [x] Regular backup and recovery procedures

### ✅ Incident Response
- [x] Security incident response plan documented
- [x] User notification procedures for breaches
- [x] Data recovery procedures documented
- [x] Regular security review schedule established

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Data Exposure**: Strong RLS policies prevent cross-user access
- **Authentication Bypass**: Supabase Auth provides enterprise-grade security
- **Session Hijacking**: JWT tokens and HTTPS prevent interception

### Medium Risk
- **Client-Side Vulnerabilities**: Standard web app risks mitigated through proper validation
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Regular updates and security scanning needed

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies current
2. **Security Monitoring**: Use Supabase's built-in monitoring
3. **Code Reviews**: Review all authentication-related code
4. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance through user data control
- Right to deletion implemented
- Data portability possible through API
- Privacy policy required for production

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 considerations addressed
- Secure coding practices followed
- Regular security assessments recommended
- Incident response procedures documented
